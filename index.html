            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I moved schools about 4 times in my life all due to moving around. I gradutated from high school in 2020 during covid and I did not have a proper graduation ceremony.
            I tried to go to college but I had no idea what major to choose from and ended up dropping out 3 times. I joined this bootcamp inhopes of finding a career and to learn 
            as much as possible!

            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <p>I started working partime in retail in 2021. It was not the best work environment, there was always toxicity in that work field. I started working in a restaurant a year
        later. I don't plan on doing part time for long and hope to find a career in software development!
